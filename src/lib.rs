//! This crate is an implementation of behavior trees in Rust. It is largely
//! based on behavior trees as described by Marzinotto et al. ^1 and was
//! designed to be used on an actual robot using LCM for communication.
//!
//! A nice overview of behavior trees can be found on
//! [Craft AI's website](http://www.craft.ai/blog/bt-101-behavior-trees-grammar-basics/).
