//! Nodes that tick their children in parallel
use crate::node::{Node, Tickable};
use crate::status::Status;

/// A node that handles "concurrent" behavior.
///
/// Every tick, this node will tick all of its children that have not been run
/// to completion. Success or failure of this node is determined by how many of
/// its children are in a successful or failed state. If the specified number
/// of children have succeeded, this node succeeds. If it is impossible for the
/// remaining children to bring the success count to the required threshold then
/// the node fails. Otherwise it is considered running.
///
/// Note that a threshold of zero means this node always succeeds on the first
/// tick and a threshold greater than the number of children means this node
/// always fails on the first tick.
///
/// It is also important to note that this node can cause child `Action` nodes
/// to actually run in parallel.
///
/// # State
///
/// **Initialized:** Before being ticked after either being created or reset.
///
/// **Running:** As long as the successful child count is below the threshold
/// and the running children could potentially make the successful count cross
/// the threshold.
///
/// **Succeeded:** The count of successful children is greater than the threshold.
///
/// **Failed:** The sum of the successful children and the running children is
/// smaller than the threshold.
///
/// # Children
///
/// Any number. The children will be reset when this node is reset but may not
/// necessarily ticked when this node is, depending on their current status.
///
/// There is a possibility that some children may not be ticked to completion
/// based on when the `Parallel` node crosses its success or failure threshold.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// A node that has enough successful children:
///
/// ```
/// # use aspen::std_nodes::*;
/// # use aspen::Status;
/// # use aspen::node::Tickable;
/// let threshold = 3;
/// let mut node = Parallel::new(threshold, vec![
///     AlwaysSucceed::new(),
///     AlwaysSucceed::new(),
///     AlwaysSucceed::new(),
///     AlwaysRunning::new(),
///     AlwaysFail::new()
/// ]);
///
/// assert_eq!(node.tick(&mut ()), Status::Succeeded);
/// ```
///
/// A node that could either succeed or fail, so it is still running:
///
/// ```
/// # use aspen::std_nodes::*;
/// # use aspen::Status;
/// # use aspen::node::Tickable;
/// let threshold = 3;
/// let mut node = Parallel::new(threshold, vec![
///     AlwaysSucceed::new(),
///     AlwaysSucceed::new(),
///     AlwaysRunning::new(),
///     AlwaysRunning::new(),
///     AlwaysFail::new()
/// ]);
///
/// assert_eq!(node.tick(&mut ()), Status::Running);
/// ```
///
/// A node that could not possibly succeed, so it fails:
///
/// ```
/// # use aspen::std_nodes::*;
/// # use aspen::Status;
/// # use aspen::node::Tickable;
/// let threshold = 4;
/// let mut node = Parallel::new(threshold, vec![
