/// A node that will tick its children in order as long as they succeed.
///
/// This node will tick all of its children in order until one of them returns
/// either `Status::Running` or `Status::Failed`. If none do, this node succeeds.
///
/// The difference between this node and the normal `Sequence` is that this
/// node will always begin ticking from its first child, where as the normal
/// version will resume ticking with the node that previously returned that it
/// was running. This makes the active version better for things that must be
/// checked each tick (e.g., if motors are too hot) and the normal version better
/// for completing series of actions.
///
/// Due to the reticking, some nodes that succeeded on previous ticks may fail
/// on later ticks.
///
/// This node is equivalent to an "and" statement.
///
/// # State
///
/// **Initialized:** Before being ticked after being created or reset.
///
/// **Running:** The latest ticked child node return that it was running.
///
/// **Succeeded:** All child nodes succeeded.
///
/// **Failed:** All child nodes failed.
///
/// # Children
///
/// Any number of children. A child node will be ticked every time this node is
/// ticked as long as all the sibling nodes to the left succeeded.
///
/// Note that, if a node is running and a sibling to the left returned either
/// failure or running, the child node will be reset. Additionally, the children
/// will be reset each time the parent is.
///

///
/// A node that returns success:
///
/// ```

/// let mut node = ActiveSequence::new()
